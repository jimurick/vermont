    "text": "App\nShiny apps have two main parts:\n\nThe user interface (typically using the variable ui) defines the layout and the widgets included in the app.\nThe server (typically a function named server) determines the interactions connecting the widgets.\n\nThere are a lot of basic widgets that come with the shiny package (widget gallery). There are also a lot of free packages that were created with the htmlwidgets package (htmlwidgets gallery). Many of those were developed for javascript widgets, and htmlwidgets allowed people to create R wrappers for them.\nWidgets can be grouped into two categories: input widgets take data from users, and output widgets display data to users. There are also intermediate (between input & output) objects, like the dataframes in the app created by the reactive() function. See Basic reactivity from Mastering Shiny for more."

It was taken from the amap package (here) and modified to add a parameter that’s in the SAS k-means function FASTCLUS.\nMost data manipulation is done with the package data.table, because it’s much faster than dplyr."
