There are also a lot of free packages that were created with the htmlwidgets package (htmlwidgets gallery). Many of those were developed for javascript widgets, and htmlwidgets allowed people to create R wrappers for them.\nWidgets can be grouped into two categories: input widgets take data from users, and output widgets display data to users. There are also intermediate (between input & output) objects, like the dataframes in the app created by the reactive() function. See Basic reactivity from Mastering Shiny for more."
