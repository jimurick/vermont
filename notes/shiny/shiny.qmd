```{r setup}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
```

This section will describe the example in the repo's `{r} repo_link("examples folder", "examples/shiny")`.

The app is posted on shinyapps.io: <https://jimurick.shinyapps.io/HospitalStarRatings/>

## My R Package: `hospitalstars`

This shiny app uses an R package I 
[hospitalstars](https://github.com/jimurick/hospitalstars)

It may be interesting because

- Most data manipulation is done with the package `data.table`, because it's much faster than `dplyr`.
- There is a C++ implementation of the [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm. It was taken from the `amap` package ([here](https://github.com/cran/amap/blob/master/src/kmeans.cpp)) and modified to add a parameter from the SAS implementation ([`FASTCLUS`](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.4/statug/statug_fastclus_overview.htm)).
