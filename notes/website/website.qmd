```{r setup}

```

This section will describe the example in the main repo folder and the `{r} repo_link("notes folder", "notes")`.

[Quarto websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)

## Files

The main project folder includes these files:

- `_quarto.yml` - configuration file (see [Configuration](#configuration) below)
- `index.qmd` - Quarto notebook that is the main page of the website
- `README.qmd` - Quarto notebook rendered to `README.md` by running the command `quarto render README.qmd -t md` in the RStudio Terminal
- `jim.ico` - I wrote my name with MS Paint and converted the PNG file to ICO
- `scipts/`
    - `util.R` - Variables and functions that may be needed in various places
    - `style.scss` - A Sass file used to create some CSS for the website
    - `util.js` - One javascript function that's used when you click the button on the map's popups
    - `latex.js` - Some javascript that does the mathjax analog of $\LaTeX$ def/newcommand type commands (see the [mathjax docs](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/macros.html))
- `.gitignore` - used by git to specify filename patterns to exclude from the repo
- `.Rprofile` - run when the project is opened; it defines some functions I want to be generally available

## Configuration

The top of `_quarto.yml` describes the type of project, where the final website should go (`{r} repo_link("notes folder", "docs")`), and which Quarto notebook files need to be rendered to HTML.

```
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
  render:
    - index.qmd
    - notes/quarto/quarto.qmd
    - notes/shiny/shiny.qmd
    - notes/website/website.qmd
```

The next part 

```
website:
  title: "Vermont State Notes"
  favicon: jim.ico
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: notes/quarto/quarto.qmd
        text: Quarto
      - href: notes/shiny/shiny.qmd
        text: Shiny
      - href: notes/website/website.qmd
        text: Website
    tools:
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/jimurick/vermont
```

This is similar to the [Header](https://jimurick.github.io/vermont/notes/quarto/quarto.html#header) section of the 

```
format:
  html:
    theme: scripts/styles.scss
    css: scripts/styles.scss
    toc: true
    monofont: Fira Code
    html-math-method: mathjax
    include-in-header:
      - text: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fira+Code" rel="stylesheet">
      - text: <script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/util.js"></script>
      - text: <script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/latex.js"></script>
```
