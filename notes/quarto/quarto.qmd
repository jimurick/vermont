This section has some notes on the [Quarto notebook example](../../examples/quarto/quarto_example.html). The source code is in file `{r} repo_link("quarto_example.qmd", "examples/quarto/quarto_example.qmd")`.

## Header

The top of the file has this section of YAML configuration info, delimited by 3 dashes above and below.

``` {.yaml .sourceCode}

You can find lots of options in the [HTML Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) documentation page. The ones I used are

-   [`toc and toc-depth`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#table-of-contents) put the table of contents on the top-right part of the screen
-   [`embed-resources`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#self-contained) renders the qmd file to a single HTML file, which includes dependencies like javascript or image files. This makes it easier to share.
-   [`monofont`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#basic-options) specifies the Fira Code font for code
-   [`html-math-methods`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#latex-equations) specifies [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) as the engine for rendering math
-   [`include-in-header`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#includes) brings in a few files:
    -   a Javascript script for $\LaTeX$ macros,
    -   a CSS file to change the color of text in`<code>` elements,
    -   Google's [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) font, and
    -   my logo, ![](../../jim.ico){width="20px"}, for the [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon)

## MathJax Macros

The file `{r} repo_link("latex.js", "examples/quarto/latex.js")` sets this Javascript object:

``` {.javascript .sourceCode}
window.MathJax = {
  tex: {
    macros: {
      y: "\\mathbf{y}",
      X: "\\mathbf{X}",
      R: "\\mathbb{R}",
      eps: "\\varepsilon",
      epsB: "\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}",
      betaB: "\\boldsymbol{\\beta}",
      Var: ["\\mathop{\\mathrm{Var}}", 0]
    }
  }
};
```

This is equivalent to the following $\LaTeX$ commands.

-   `\def\y{\mathbf{y}}`
-   `\def\X{\mathbf{X}}`
-   `\def\R{\mathbb{R}}`
-   `\def\eps{\varepsilon}`
-   `\def\epsB{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}`
-   `\def\betaB{\boldsymbol{\beta}}`
-   `\DeclareMathOperator{\Var}{Var}`

The `\def`s allow me to write the multivariate linear regression equation $\y=\X\betaB$ as `\y=\X\betaB`.

The `\DeclareMathOperator` lets you write `\Var\y` for statistical variance, $\Var\y$, in a way that looks nicer than, say `\textrm{Var}\y`=$\textrm{Var}\y$.

## Code Chunk Options

You may have noticed that some code chunks use options at the top like the following.

-   `output=FALSE` - I use this when loading packages to prevent annoying messages from being printed in the HTML
-   `fig.width=4, fig.height=3` - those control the dimensions of the image, and generally involve some trial and error to settle on

Code chunk options are generally part of the [`knitr`](https://yihui.org/knitr/) package, but [this Quarto page](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) is a good general reference.
